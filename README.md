# A to to list
This is a small list of tasks. 

There is no backend, so the list is not persistent. I plan to use it for daily task tracking, thus it's OK. Long term plans are managed separately. Probably later it can be extended with either backend of service worker in order to save a list.

An idea: covert to a general day-management app:
- show local time, sun and moon phase - adjust visual background according (like a sky color change)
- show a list of tasks for the day (find an API for local day-night cycle)
- show a schedule - put the tasks on a timeline
- show meal recipe suggestions and fill in the schedule with meals (search for a healthy diet API)
- suggest a physical activity (average daily time budget and probable time schedule - need a sports/active lifestyle API)
